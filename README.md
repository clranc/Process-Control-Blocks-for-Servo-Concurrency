# Process-Control-Blocks-for-Servo-Concurrency
The project can be built using keil uvision and is made for the STM32L476VG Discovery Kit.

The user prompt can be used via screen or putty at 9600 baud with a connection to UART2 on the microcontroller.

Pins PA0 and PA1 on port A are used for PWM output signals of the servos.
